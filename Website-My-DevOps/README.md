# Website-My-DevOps
"My DevOps", takes inspiration from management style websites such as Trello, Azure DevOps & Monday. 

In contrast to those tools,"My DevOps" was created for myself as a way for me to track: 
- What I want to learn
- What I intend to learn
- What I've learnt

So feel free to look at "My DevOps" as an indication of the additional skills that I've learnt or will learn ontop of my present programming skills!
